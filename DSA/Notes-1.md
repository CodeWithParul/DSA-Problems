-> Problem Solving:
    - understand the problem
    - given in problem
    - apporach - break and solve or what ?
    - program the approach

How Programming Works:
-> flowcahrt / pseudocode (rough soln) -> source code (HLL) -> machine code translation

Flowchart:- approach in diagramatic form.
    - (_)            =            terminator (start and end).
    - parallelogram  =            I/O.
    - rectangle      =            process or calculations.
    - rhombus        =            decision making.
    - arrows         =            flow of program.
    - circle         =            connector (functions or something...)

pseudocode:- way of generic representation look. (more like english)
